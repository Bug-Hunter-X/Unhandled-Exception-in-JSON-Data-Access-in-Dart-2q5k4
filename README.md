# Unhandled Exception in JSON Data Access in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when handling JSON responses:  failure to gracefully handle potential exceptions when accessing data from a JSON response. The original code assumes a specific JSON structure and throws an exception if the structure is unexpected.

The solution showcases how to robustly handle these situations using error handling and null checks.
